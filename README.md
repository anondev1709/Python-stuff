# Python-stuff

Just some Scripts i have created for fun and as a hobby..

Feel free to modify and play with them!

dice.py == Game simulating a dice throwing. Using randint, while loop and if-else. You win if you get highest number on the dice(6)
guessTheNumber.py == Similar game to dice.py except this one is way harder. Win if you guess exact number
